Statistical Mechanics, Spring 2019 taught by Prof. Thomas Kuhlman

This repository contains my typed-up solutions for PSETs 2-4 & the Final Exam. Currently I cannot guarantee the correctness of any of my solutions, but I will go through my old work (when I have a free weekend) and fix any mistakes I catch. So please consider this a work-in-progress. 

Although it's been a few years, I distinctly remember handwriting PSET 1 . If I ever find the paper-copy (or have a free weekend that I want to spend relearning Stat Mech), I promise to add my solutions to the first hw as well.
